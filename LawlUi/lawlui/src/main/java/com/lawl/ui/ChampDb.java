/**
 * Created by Garreth on 4/27/2014.
 * Was going to use this as part of a DOA (data access object) to help to manage the data for us.
 * The DAO is responsible for handling the database connection and for accessing and modifying the data.
 * It will also convert the database objects into real Java Objects,
 * so that our user interface code does not have to deal with the persistence layer.
